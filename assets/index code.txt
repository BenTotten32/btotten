Tottenham Hotspur FC was founded in 1882 by a group of school boys whom wanted to play sports during the winter months, when cricket couldnt be played. Tottenham was one of the five founding clubs that founded the Premier League, which became the highest tier of English Football. Tottenham Hotspur is considered one of the "Big 6" of English football which include other major English clubs: Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City, and our North London rivals: Arsenal.

Tottenham Hotspur are a long standing and proud football club. Tottenham won major trophies starting in 1960's when Jimmy Greaves joined the club, this era of the early 60's is considered by most to be Tottenham's glory years. This was the last time that Tottenham won the top flight of English football.
	Yet even with a large fanbase and large market in London, Spurs cannot seem to win trophies, which are an essential part of being a big club in English and World football. But with stars such as Harry Kane and Son Hueng-Min Tottenham seem to be on the edge of winning trophies and bringing glory to Tottenham.
