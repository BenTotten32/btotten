<p>	The North London derby is the clash between two North London football clubs, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. These two teams consider each other to be their biggest rivals, and this derby is considered the most intense in England and one of the most fierce rivalries in all of sports. 193 games have been played in this historic derby with 81 wins for Arsenal, 61 wins for Tottenham, and 51 matches drawn. The leading goalscorer in this fixture is Harry Kane who has a total of 14 goals. Arsenal play their games at the Emirates stadium and Tottenham play at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, these two stadiums are only 4 miles apart which adds to the hostility between these two London giants.</p>
<p>The first meeting between Tottenham and Arsenal was a friendly on November 19 1887, but the rivalry between the two North London clubs didnt begin until 19123 when Arsenal moved to Arsenal stadium, located just four miles from Tottenham's White Hart Lane. Tottenham and Arsenal would go on to play regularly during World War 1 in the London Combination which was the regional wartime competition. This rivalry escalated in 1919 when the First Division, of English football, was expanding the amount of teams by two and Tottenham had the claim to the final spot to stay in the First Division, but somehow Arsenal, who were 6th place in the Second Division, managed to steal the final spot in the First Division which infuriated Tottenham and their supporters.</p>
<p>Since	1950 there has only been one season where Tottenham and Arsenal have not been in the same division of football. Some notable games between the two teams was March 2016 where Arsenal came back to draw 2-2 with Tottenham which ended Tottenham's hopes to win the premier league that season and May 2022 where Tottenham destroyed Arsenal 3-0 which made Tottenham jump Arsenal in the Premier league table giving Tottenham Champions League football next season.</p>
